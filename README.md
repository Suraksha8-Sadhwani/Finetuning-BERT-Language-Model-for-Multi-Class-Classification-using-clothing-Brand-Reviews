# Multi-Class Classification for Clothing Brand Reviews using Fine-Tuned BERT
# Overview:
This project focuses on fine-tuning a BERT-based language model for multi-class classification of clothing brand reviews. The goal is to classify reviews into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. The model is trained on a dataset of clothing brand reviews obtained from Kaggle.

# Project Components:
# Data Preparation:

The dataset is locally downloaded from Kaggle and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Labels are assigned to different sentiment categories in the dataset.

# Text Preprocessing:

Text data undergoes preprocessing steps, including removing special characters, single characters, and stop words.
Lemmatization is performed to reduce words to their base form.

# Fine-Tuning BERT Model:

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is utilized for sequence classification.
The model is fine-tuned on the clothing brand review dataset using the Hugging Face transformers library.

# Training Setup:

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.
Custom PyTorch DataLoader is implemented to handle tokenized text data and labels.
The model is trained using the Trainer class from the transformers library.

# Training Metrics:

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall are computed using the compute_metrics function.
Metrics are monitored during training using the Trainer class.

# Inference:

The trained model is used for making predictions on new data.
The predict function tokenizes input text and provides class probabilities and predicted labels.

# Save and Reload Model:

The trained model and tokenizer are saved for later use in inference.
The saved model can be reloaded for making predictions without retraining.

# Running the Code:
# Install required dependencies:

!pip install transformers
!pip install torch
!pip install pandas
Download the dataset from Kaggle and update the file path in the code.

Execute the provided code in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook or Google colab.

Fine-tune the BERT model by adjusting hyperparameters in the TrainingArguments.

Save the trained model for future inference.

Use the predict function to make predictions on new text data.
